# Secure Peer-to-Peer Chat Application

## Introduction
In the modern digital era, as communication largely moves online, the significance of secure communication has soared. This project intends to craft a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Chat Application that champions not only direct communication but also underpins security and user experience.

## Objective
* Design and develop a P2P chat application focusing on:
  * End-to-end encryption for message confidentiality.
  * User authentication for message integrity and non-repudiation.
  * A user-friendly interface.
  * Enabling file transfers within chats.

## Features & Enhancements

### End-to-End Encryption
* Use the cryptography library for symmetric encryption.
* Securely share session keys for individual chat sessions between peers.
* Ensure complete confidentiality of exchanged messages.

### User Authentication
* Introduce a registration system for account creation.
* Safely store usernames and hashed passwords.
* Authenticate users at every session start.

### Digital Signatures
* Deploy public and private key infrastructure.
* Sign messages using individual private keys for authenticity and non-repudiation.
* Let receivers verify messages using the sender's public key.

### Graphical User Interface (GUI)
* Craft a user-friendly GUI using the tkinter library.
* Integrate features like registration, login, chat, and file transfer.

### File Transfer
* Facilitate sending and receiving of files within chats.
* Transmit files in chunks and reconstruct at the receiving end.
* Ensure all file transfers are encrypted and secure.

## Implementation Plan & Timeline

**Week 1:**
* Research and initial planning.
* Establish a rudimentary P2P communication framework.

**Week 2:**
* Integrate end-to-end encryption.
* Kickstart user authentication development.

**Week 3:**
* Conclude user authentication and registration mechanisms.
* Initiate GUI design.

**Week 4:**
* Perfect the GUI and merge with chat features.
* Start building the file transfer feature.

**Week 5:**
* Round off the file transfer capabilities.
* Dive into testing, debugging, and documentation.
* Ready a presentation and demo.

## Conclusion
Our Secure P2P Chat Application aims to blend potent security measures with a smooth user experience. With its focus on encryption, authentication, and a user-friendly design, it promises users a secure and delightful platform for unhindered communication. This endeavor is not only in sync with current communication inclinations but also accentuates the criticality of privacy and security in digital discourse.
